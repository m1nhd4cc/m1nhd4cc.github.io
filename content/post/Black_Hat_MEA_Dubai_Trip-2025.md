Standing in the vast Black Hat MEA 2025 conference hall, watching massive LED screens displaying AI Security demos, surrounded by the buzz of thousands of security experts from across the Middle East. I felt a bit emotional but also really happy - this is what I've been hoping for since I started stumbling into this field.

From an invitation email to days immersed in the cybersecurity world - this is the story of my most memorable journey.



## From Invitation to Ticket

Around July I registered to attend BlackHat, and by November I received a confirmation email from Black Hat. I was lucky enough to be selected as a Visitor - a rare opportunity to access cutting-edge security technologies.

### Flying Straight to Dubai

*The excitement started from the ticket in my hand.*

I flew directly from Tan Son Nhat to Dubai International Airport (DXB) with the 5⭐ airline Emirates – an amazing experience with world-class service, even though I was only flying Economy

![visa](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/blackhat8.png)

![plane](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/dubai23.png)

The direct flight took about 7 hours

![time](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/dubai31.png)

Throughout the flight, I reviewed the Black Hat agenda, mentally preparing myself for what was coming.

![timeline](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/timeline.png)

The in-flight meal included pasta, mashed potatoes, and dessert. But personally, I found the food just average, the dessert was actually tasty =]]

![food_air](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/dubai30.png)

A signature feature of Emirates is their cabin lighting. When the lights are dimmed at night, the ceiling glows with hundreds of tiny LEDs, simulating a starry night sky just like the one outside

![emirates-star](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/emirates-star.png)

After checking the agenda and finishing my meal, I managed to take a short nap. When I woke up, we were already approaching Dubai, and the view below left a strong impression on me.

[Palm Jumeirah](https://maps.app.goo.gl/senM3zDWnqic93UN8) in Dubai are three artificial islands developed by Nakheel Properties in the United Arab Emirates. The trio includes Palm Jumeirah, Palm Jebel Ali, and Palm Deira, with construction having started back in 2001

### First Impressions 🇦🇪

Stepping off at the airport, the first thing that blew my mind wasn't the heat, but the futuristic architecture of the airport - everything was gleaming, modern like a sci-fi movie

I couldn't believe I had actually set foot in Dubai

![dubai5](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/dubai5.png)

Actually, Dubai is just one of the emirates in the UAE, not a country itself. However, it stands as the main source of tourism and the economic powerhouse of the nation, acting as a magnet that draws the whole world to this desert land.

### Getting to Camping

I caught a ride to the [camping](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8RZs5MV81485cYaT9) site near the [Riyadh Exhibition & Convention Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dgsvagxuf4MzQTwD7)  (about an 11 hour drive from the airport)

On the way, I saw them hanging banners about the event.

![G7LbTh-WYAAXYJl](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/G7LbTh-WYAAXYJl.jpg)

Took the chance to check out the map of exhibitor booths beforehand.

## BlackHat MEA Highlights

### Check-in & Badge

The atmosphere at the conference center was incredibly lively. The badge pickup process was quick too.

Walking around Black Hat, I was truly impressed because it's so huge and beautiful. It's like a whole area built specifically just for this event.

*These Arab guys are seriously rich*

After checking in and getting my badge, I took a tour around.
Banners of Black Hat everywhere.

I was pretty impressed with the stage where famous speakers in cybersecurity would gather and share - it's massive and grand.

### Tech Showcase & Booths

Walking around the exhibition booths, I saw tons of demos on AI Security, Cloud Defense, and Offensive Security...

**Let me walk you through some impressive booths:**
Right from my first step into the exhibition area, I was already "wowed" by this booth 😂

![hacker_shop.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/hacker_shop.jpg)

The hooded black hacker statue fits the stereotype perfectly, but I gotta admit it's got serious presence!

![1764679288663.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/1764679288663.jpg)


What impressed me most was how the booths were designed in cyberpunk, futuristic style - from neon colors, LED lights, to the spatial layout. Each booth was like a miniature tech world.

Maybe what makes hackers cry is deadlines...

A brand synonymous with SOC 🔥

### Hardware & Hacking Demo

The part I was most excited about was the booths demoing hacking devices. **IoT Hacking** is a hot trend in the industry, and witnessing real-time attacks on smart devices was truly an unforgettable experience.

![iothacking.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/iothacking.png)


I stuck around to watch this demo because it's related to tasks at my company.

There were also some pretty impressive network hacking tools.

![1763476244487.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/1763476244487.jpg)

And here they demo payment hacking, banking, card devices,...
I also tried messing around a bit with my crappy reverse skills =]]]

That wraps up the first day at Black Hat... *evenings here are quite beautiful*

![G7RMNJ3XsAAPC4j.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/G7RMNJ3XsAAPC4j.jpg)

I did give the local cuisine a try, but honestly, it didn't quite suit my taste. Most dishes are prepared with a distinct Middle Eastern palate, meaning they are very heavy on Masala. However, the lamb was actually quite good - they prepared it perfectly without any of that strong gamey smell

Also, you won't find small individual bowls here bcz everyone just eats together from one massive platter. It’s usually served with Khubz (Arabic bread), which you tear off and use to scoop up the food

![dubai-food.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/dubai-food.png)

<details style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05); border-radius: 10px; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 4px solid #4A5D23;">

  <div style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic; color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.6;">
    <p>
      When it comes to meat, <strong>lamb</strong> is the main staple here, followed by chicken and beef. Since this is a Muslim country, the locals strictly do not eat pork. The food here is standard <strong>Halal</strong>. Walking through the local markets, the meat displays actually reminded me of the traditional meat stalls back in Vietnam - everything is incredibly fresh, raw, and hung openly just like at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      And most locals eat with their bare hands (as you might already know). But here's an interesting cultural rule: regardless of whether they are left or right hand, they strictly eat with their <strong>right hand</strong>. The left hand is traditionally reserved for 'personal hygiene' tasks and is considered unclean. So, if you pass food or an object to someone, never use your left hand - it's considered a serious insult =]]]

The next day I stopped by the area where the CTF finals were taking place. Where battles were happening fiercely and intensely.

![594378476_24957184347311087_48234188493580598_n.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat//594378476_24957184347311087_48234188493580598_n.jpg)

Actually, I did participate in the Quals CTF round before that, but with my beginner level I didn't make it to Finals. But that's okay, just standing on the sidelines watching the pros compete taught me a lot 💪

After that I continued exploring.

### Last Moments at Black Hat

![1764688390352.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/1764688390352.jpg)

The event lasted for three days, but I only attended for two. I spent the next two days traveling back to Dubai to explore the local culture, sights, and cuisine with my companion

![G7LsRQuW0AAeKCy.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/G7LsRQuW0AAeKCy.jpg)


So btw, the technical sessions, conversations with international experts, to hands-on testing of the latest hacking tools - everything left an unforgettable mark on my career journey 🦾

After wandering for a while it got dark, so I headed back to camp to prepare my stuff.



## Dubai Trip 🐫

**04/12**

After hours of "brain-draining" with code and security vulnerabilities, I spent the next two days exploring Dubai's lavish beauty with my friend.

### Asiana Hotel

After brain-straining hours of hacking at Black Hat, armed with my personal notes, we moved from the camping site to the [**Asiana Hotel**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hoargr3s4UrtjYAf7). We decided to station ourselves here for two days to explore the city's sights

Since travel and check-in ate up most of the day, our first day was limited to just two spots: Global Village and Global Market

### Global Market

[Global Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5v6q7KR9KomLZEwq5) bustling hub of commerce that contrasts with the city's modern malls, this market area captures the true trading spirit of Dubai. It serves as a vibrant meeting point for diverse cultures, offering everything from exotic spices and textiles to gold and daily goods. 

Unlike the organized entertainment of Global Village, the market here offers a raw, authentic atmosphere where the air is filled with the scent of spices and the energetic sounds of bargaining, a true paradise for those looking to experience the local commercial pulse.

![603845656_3213108848857713_5886553783530974927_n.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/603845656_3213108848857713_5886553783530974927_n.jpg)

Also, since the majority of the population here is Muslim, they generally don't drink alcohol. However, you can still find bars or alcohol service in hotels and certain specific locations (probably mainly to cater to tourists).

![603875241_3213108605524404_4260769843149356074_n.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/603875241_3213108605524404_4260769843149356074_n.jpg)

I gave some local dishes a try here, but honestly, they didn't quite suit my taste. It makes sense, though since over 80% of the UAE's population are expatriates (mostly from India and the broader Middle East), the local cuisine and culture are heavily influenced by these regions

  <div style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic; color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.6;">
    <p>
      The total population here is around 8 million, but surprisingly, native Emiratis only account for about 1 million, scattered across the 7 emirates. The vast majority are expats - predominantly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh… Among the Southeast Asian community, Filipinos make up the largest group.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unique demographic is exactly what makes Dubai so fascinating. It is a true melting pot where countless identities, cultures, and ethnicities coexist side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Btw, the indigenous people here are <strong>Nomads</strong> (historically known as Bedouins). They traditionally didn't settle in one fixed location but were constantly on the move. If they felt their current spot was no longer suitable or resourceful, they would simply pack up and migrate to a new place to live.

### Global Village

Claimed to be the UAE's most significant tourism and leisure project, [Global Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G97VV2jkoCdZByLV7) is the region's first premier destination for culture, entertainment, and shopping. Spanning over 17.2 million square feet and attracting more than 5 million visitors annually, this massive complex is managed by Dubailand on the city's outskirts. The event runs during the winter season (from late November to late February) as a key part of the Dubai Shopping Festival.

The park features pavilions representing around 80 different countries - each designed to mimic famous landmarks of that nation (sadly, there’s no Vietnam pavilion yet =))) )

It is the perfect place to hunt for souvenirs from around the world, enjoy authentic global cuisine, and watch exciting street performances.

Oh, one tip for anyone traveling here - ***haggle hard***. Because they mark up prices for tourists many times over the actual value =]]]

      The "Best Friend" Act: They will pretend to love your country/nationality to build a false sense of rapport. Once you let your guard down, they quote an sky-high price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Currency Switch: They agree on a number (which you naturally assume is in **AED**), but when it's time to pay, they insist they meant **USD** (making it nearly 4 times more expensive).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bait and Switch: After agreeing on a price for a specific item, they slyly swap it for a lower-quality version while packing it for you.

### St. Mary's Catholic Church

I woke up the next morning bursting with energy. As I mentioned earlier, since this is a predominantly Muslim country, mosques are everywhere. For this trip, I decided to visit two of the most famous in the region

[St. Mary's Catholic Church](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8YVw8MeZM9FEU6y7)

![605561233_3213108715524393_2409705758808169788_n.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/605561233_3213108715524393_2409705758808169788_n.jpg)

Since Christmas was around the corner, they had already started decorating

![604718246_3213108898857708_935336172122284824_n.jpg](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/604718246_3213108898857708_935336172122284824_n.jpg)

### Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque

[Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4a8heq1aGhgdJuX1A) is an unforgettable place. The Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi is a place of breathtaking beauty and serenity. It is immaculately clean and well-maintained, making it an absolute must-visit destination.

![dubai8.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/dubai8.png)

However, be prepared for a bit of a walk, this complex is massive! Upon arrival, you will be guided on how to navigate the grounds. Head toward the dead-end on the right to collect your free ticket/pass, then turn left to proceed.

![dubai28.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/dubai28.png)

This is easily a 2-3 hour activity, so plan your schedule accordingly. **Dress modestly -** shoulders and knees must be covered; avoid graphic t-shirts and shorts.

**Heed:** 

> Wear comfortable shoes and stay hydrated. Photography is allowed in designated areas.
> 

> You can rent traditional attire here, but a crucial note for women: you must wear long sleeves and long trousers. There is a strict inspection before entry. While the rules are somewhat more relaxed for men, they are much stricter for women

### Burj Khalifa

The world's tallest building [Burj Khalifa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9KbHt5wE2iQ9SXeU6)
Standing at a staggering **829.8 meters (2,722 ft)**, the Burj Khalifa has held the title of the world's tallest structure since its topping out in 2009. Designed as the centerpiece of Downtown Dubai, this megatall skyscraper was officially opened in 2010. It is truly an engineering marvel that dominates the city skyline.

![buji_kalifa.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/buji_kalifa.png)

Unfortunately, we couldn't get tickets to the observation deck to go up and enjoy the panoramic city view (which is quite similar to the experience at Landmark 81 in Vietnam). The tickets were completely sold out (you need to book them at least a week) 😢

### **Museum of The Future**

The [Museum of the Future](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TjnxkpLr7jB6tkL89) is an exhibition space dedicated to innovative ideologies, services, and products. Located in the Dubai Financial District, it officially opened its doors on February 22, 2022. The museum's primary goal is to promote development and innovation in the fields of robotics and AI.

![museum_future.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/museum_future.png)

Just like the Burj Khalifa, was also completely sold out when we inquired. Both are incredibly hot tourist spots here, so we had to settle for just standing in the lobby.

![in_mf.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/in_mf.png)

It’s so cute, but also incredibly high-tech

![cute_tech.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/cute_tech.png)

### Al Bastakiya

Our final destination was the [Bastakiya Old Town](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z2W6aAChycXCKt5D7)

This place serves as a cultural and historical icon of Dubai, deeply imbued with the distinct characteristics of Middle Eastern culture. Bastakiya is a remarkably well-preserved old quarter, featuring narrow alleyways, traditional houses, and iconic wind towers (Barjeel), creating a unique and visually stunning architectural space

![ai_astakiya.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/ai_astakiya.png)

Built in the late 19th century by Persian merchants, the quarter stands as a testament to history. The houses here were constructed using mud and brick, featuring flat roofs and narrow corridors. The architecture demonstrates a brilliant adaptation to the scorching desert climate, naturally creating a cool and comfortable environment inside.

  <div style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic; color: #d0d0d0; line-height: 1.6;">
    <p>
      This design is a staple of traditional Arab architecture. If you look closely at the large wooden gate, you'll notice a smaller door embedded in the bottom left corner
    </p>
    <p>
      The large door was reserved for men, while the smaller one was for women. This design was deeply rooted in the past cultural practice of modesty, where women were required to cover their faces in the presence of strange men
    </p>
    <p>
      The doors essentially served as a signaling system: a knock on the small door indicated a female guest had arrived, letting the women of the house know they didn't need to veil themselves. Conversely, a knock on the main door signaled a male visitor, alerting the women inside to cover up before the door was opened

On our way between destinations, we were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the local wildlife, which offered a peaceful break from the bustling city vibe.

We stopped by the [**Ras Al Khor**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tSq436L5JctUsop3A) and the view was absolutely surreal. Thousands of pink flamingos were gathering in the wetlands, creating a striking contrast against the backdrop of Dubai's massive skyscrapers. It’s a rare spot where nature and modern urbanization coexist in harmony

We also spotted the [**Arabian Oryx**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bPpyETafQfv7eAjt8) wandering through the desert sands. Known as the national animal of the UAE, seeing them in their natural habitat was truly special

![dubai7.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/dubai/dubai7.png)

One regret is not getting to experience the desert safari with a Land Cruiser on sand dunes, riding camels, or having a Bedouin-style dinner in the desert. But that's also a reason for me to want to come back to Dubai again.

In the evening there was a fire dance performance

The futuristic vibe

## The End

Looking back, this trip brought me far more than I expected - it wasn't just about attending a conference, but a complete immersion into a new world. Professionally, the days at Black Hat MEA were invaluable. I walked away with fresh insights into AI Security and IoT Hacking, updated by top experts, and a deeper understanding of the real world challenges our industry faces. It was an intense but incredibly rewarding mark on my career journey

But the experience didn't stop at the venue's exit doors. Shifting from the digital world to the desert heat, I found myself captivated by the contrasts of the UAE. From the peaceful serenity of the Grand Mosque and the historic whispers of Al Bastakiya’s old doors to the futuristic architecture that dominates the skyline, every moment was a lesson. I even picked up some essential "survival skills" along the way, mastering the art of hardcore haggling to navigate the dazzling, yet sometimes tricky, local markets.

![cert.png](/images/blackhatmea2025/blackhat/cert.png)

I'll definitely come back - next time with a fuller checklist and... a thicker wallet 😄

Thank you for taking the time to read my blog about this memorable journey ❤️ Thankful!
