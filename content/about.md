## About Me

Hi, I'm **Dang Minh Duc**, a passionate cybersecurity student, you can call me **ducnocrypt** ^^

I'm a student from [GDU - Gia Dinh University](https://giadinh.edu.vn/), currently working at [PwC](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en.html) & [Hpt](https://hpt.vn/) as **Security Operation Center (SOC)**.

I love playing **CTFs** and exploring cybersecurity. In particular, i'm currently focusing on **Forensic**, a bit of **Cryptography** and **Reverse Engineering** topics.
I'm also playing for [SnowyOwl!](https://ctftime.org/team/302484).

Since you're reading my blog, hope you enjoy it and have a great day!

## Journeys

I love traveling. Anyway, I hope that someday I can visit other countries (Japan, ~~Korea~~, ~~UAE~~, USA, ...) as well. I love experiencing different cultures...
